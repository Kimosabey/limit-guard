# 🚀 Getting Started with LimitGuard

> **Prerequisites**
> *   **Docker Desktop** (for Redis)
> *   **Node.js v18+** (LTS)

## 1. Environment Setup

The system includes a smart orchestrator (`start_dev.js`) that handles configuration, but you can check `.env` if needed.

**Backend (`.env`)**
```ini
PORT=4000
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

**Frontend (`dashboard/.env.local`)**
*Automatically generated by the start script.*
```ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://localhost:4000/api/test
```

## 2. Installation & Launch (The Easy Way)

We use a "Turbo" script to setup everything in parallel.

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Root (Backend)
npm install

# Dashboard (Frontend)
cd dashboard && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Start the Stack
This single command handles:
1.  **SSL Generation**: Creates self-signed certs for HTTPS.
2.  **Infrastructure**: Starts Redis via Docker.
3.  **Services**: Launches Backend (4000) and Dashboard (3000).

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 3. Usage Guide

1.  **Open Dashboard**: Go to `http://localhost:3000` (or `https` if redirected).
2.  **Accept Certs**: Since they are self-signed, click "Advanced -> Proceed" if your browser warns you.
3.  **Test Limits**:
    *   Click "Test Request" 10 times. (Green).
    *   Click 11th time. (Red - Blocked).
4.  **Observe**:
    *   The "Traffic Volume" chart updates in real-time.
    *   The "Reset Timer" counts down exactly in sync with Redis.

## 4. Troubleshooting

**"SSL Error" or "Privacy Warning"**
*   **Fix**: Click "Advanced" -> "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)".
*   **Why**: We use genuine TLS/SSL for security, but we (Harshan Aiyappa) are not a global Root CA, so browsers warn you. This is standard for local dev.

**"Redis Connection Failed"**
*   **Fix**: Ensure Docker is running.
*   **Behavior**: The app will switch to **Fail-Open** mode (allowing traffic) and log an error.
